**Outside Work For Pay**

 Last updated: 5/5/2006

::: {xmlns=""}
**IV. ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES (*Cont.*)**
:::

*The following policy was approved by the Board of Trustees on August 9,
1951 and revised on May 5, 2006.*

**I. Policy Overview**

Full time faculty members are compensated for full time professional
effort for the University. Faculty may have duties in instruction,
research, or outreach, or in a combination of these areas. Regardless of
the character of the faculty member\'s duties, the University expects
that each full-time faculty member will carry a reasonable and full time
load, assuming a proper share of the total functions and
responsibilities of the department/school, college, and University.
Within this framework, the University recognizes that, through
consulting and other relationships with government, industry,
not-for-profit organizations, and others outside the University, its
faculty members can make valuable contributions off campus while
enhancing their expertise in their discipline.

This Policy is intended to protect the integrity of the
faculty-University professional relationship, to ensure that approved
outside work for pay is consistent with the University\'s mission, and
to provide that faculty members remain accessible to students,
colleagues, and the public.

**II. Applicability^1^**

This Policy applies to all faculty members (tenure system and fixed
term) at the rank of instructor through professor who hold appointments
of at least 50% time. ^**2 **^ Faculty appointed less than full-time are
not eligible to perform outside work for pay during regular University
duty periods. With the exception of the approval process, outside work
for pay performed during non-duty periods is subject to the remaining
provisions of this Policy.

Certain activities are expected of faculty members as part of their
normal scholarly activities and are not regulated by this Policy (even
if a faculty member is paid to do them by a person or entity other than
the University). These include, but are not limited to **^3^** :

::: {xmlns=""}
-   presentations at professional meetings and other similar gatherings
-   peer review of articles and grant proposals
-   leadership positions in professional societies
-   preparation of scholarly publications
-   editorial services for educational or professional organizations
-   service on advisory committees or evaluation panels for government
    funding agencies, nonprofit foundations, or educational
    organizations
-   musical and other creative performances and exhibitions, if there is
    an expectation in the faculty member\'s discipline that he/she will
    engage in such performances or exhibitions.
:::

**III. Limitations on Performing Outside Work for Pay During Duty
Periods**

Faculty members may request approval to engage in outside work for pay
during duty periods if all of the following conditions exist:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  All approved outside work for pay and overload pay assignments for
    the faculty member will not exceed a total average of four (4) days
    a month.
2.  The work in question will enhance the faculty member\'s expertise as
    a teacher and scholar in his/her discipline.
3.  The work will not interfere with the performance of the faculty
    member\'s University duties, including those non classroom
    responsibilities expected of all faculty members.
4.  The work will not adversely affect the University\'s interests or
    violate University policies or regulations.
5.  The work will be of a professional nature.
:::

**IV. Definitions**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  \"Outside work\" is any work performed for a person or entity other
    than Michigan State University.
2.  \"Work\" is any service or activity in the general area of expertise
    for which the faculty member is employed by the University. Examples
    of work include, but are not limited to, consulting, advising,
    research, demonstrating, performing, outreach, or teaching in the
    faculty member\'s discipline.
3.  \"Pay\" is anything of value received in consideration for work
    (except reimbursement of expenses, indemnification, or insurance
    coverage for claims arising out of or occurring in connection with
    the work). Examples of pay include, but are not limited to, any
    salary, fee, honorarium, stock, stock option, monetary gift or
    contribution beyond actual expense, or the promise of any of these
    in the future. Work for any business or other for-profit enterprise
    owned or operated by a faculty member or by his/her relative(s),
    shall be considered \"pay\" (whether or not the faculty member
    receives anything of value in consideration for the work) because of
    the likelihood that the faculty member\'s work will increase the
    value of the business or enterprise to the faculty member\'s direct
    or indirect financial benefit.
:::

**V. Required Approval**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  A faculty member must request and obtain the written approval of
    his/her unit administrator and dean/separately reporting director
    before engaging in outside work for pay.
2.  University administrators to whom the Authorization Form is
    submitted may seek additional information or clarification from the
    faculty member regarding the proposed outside work for pay.
3.  University administrators shall process completed Authorization
    Forms in a timely fashion.
4.  If a request to engage in outside work for pay is denied, the unit
    administrator shall provide the faculty member with written reasons
    for the denial. A faculty member may not challenge a decision to
    deny approval for outside work for pay through the Faculty Grievance
    Policy unless the faculty member alleges that the denial is contrary
    to University policy or established practice.
5.  Each dean/separately reporting director shall keep Authorization
    Forms submitted by faculty on file for at least three years.
6.  Each dean/separately reporting director shall submit annual reports
    to the Office of the Provost concerning the outside work for pay
    performed by faculty in that college/administrative unit. The
    reports shall not identify individual faculty by name.
:::

**VI. Non-Duty Periods**

Faculty who hold academic year appointments or part-time appointments of
at least 50% time may engage in outside work for pay during non-duty
periods if the work does not adversely affect the University\'s
interests, violate University policies or regulations, or circumvent
University policies or regulations that would apply if the work was
performed during the duty period. The University does not limit the
amount of time faculty may spend on outside work for pay at times other
than their duty periods.

A faculty member must provide written notice to his/her unit
administrator prior to engaging in outside work for pay during non-duty
periods by submitting an Outside Work for Pay Authorization form.

**VII. Intellectual Property**

The University\'s policies regarding intellectual property are
applicable to faculty members engaging in outside work for pay.

**VIII. Indemnification**

Outside work for pay is not covered under the University\'s
Indemnification Policy or its Travel Accident Plan.

**IX. Other Provisions**

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Faculty may use University facilities, supplies and materials,
    equipment, services, or employees for outside work for pay, but only
    if (a) such use would not be contrary to University policy or
    collective bargaining agreements, (b) such use would not adversely
    affect the use or availability of such facilities, supplies and
    materials, equipment, services, or personnel for unit and other
    University activities and operations; and (c) the University is
    reimbursed in full for the fair market value of the use of the
    facilities, supplies and materials, equipment, services, or
    employees. **^4^** **\
    **
2.  If a faculty member seeks to use intellectual property owned by the
    University in outside work for pay, the unit administrator must
    consult with the Office of Intellectual Property before the outside
    work for pay may be approved or performed. The purposes of this
    consultation are to avoid violation of third party licenses, to
    prevent loss of patent rights through premature public disclosure,
    and to preserve the rights of other authors or inventors.
3.  When engaged in outside work for pay, faculty members must make it
    clear that (a) they are acting in their individual capacities and
    not on behalf of the University; and (b) that the University does
    not endorse, sponsor, or support the outside work. A faculty member
    may use his/her University title when signing reports and letters
    pertaining to outside work for pay so long as it is clear that the
    University title is used solely to document his/her professional
    credentials. Official University letterhead shall not be used in
    outside work for pay.
4.  Faculty members shall not divert to outside work for pay research or
    teaching opportunities that might reasonably be offered to the
    University, nor should they knowingly participate in outside work
    for pay that might compete with the University\'s programs.
5.  The involvement of University students or staff (especially those
    for whom the faculty member has oversight responsibilities) in a
    faculty member\'s outside work for pay must be disclosed and may
    require monitoring.
6.  Approval for outside work for pay is subject to termination at any
    time the University considers such action to be advisable. Written
    reasons for the decision to terminate approval will be provided to
    the faculty member by his/her unit administrator. Decisions to
    terminate approval for outside work for pay are not disciplinary
    action. A faculty member who wishes to challenge a decision
    terminating outside work for pay through the Faculty Grievance
    Policy must allege that the termination is contrary to University
    policy or established practice.
7.  When involvement in outside work for pay substantially interferes
    with a faculty member\'s performance of his/her University duties,
    the faculty member\'s unit administrator may issue an administrative
    warning to the faculty member or the faculty member and his/her unit
    administrator may arrange by mutual agreement a voluntary unpaid
    leave of absence or a reduction in the faculty member\'s
    appointment. Voluntary leaves of absence should normally not exceed
    six months, and the frequency and duration of leaves of absence
    should not impair a faculty member\'s contributions to the
    University.
8.  Violation of this Policy may be the basis for discipline under
    applicable University policies.
9.  Individual colleges or other units may establish lower maximum time
    limits for outside work for pay than those stipulated in this Policy
    and may promulgate guidelines and impose reporting requirements for
    outside work for pay in addition to those set forth in this Policy.
:::

**X. Applicability to the Medical Colleges**

Faculty in the Colleges of Human Medicine, Nursing, and Osteopathic
Medicine may engage in outside work for pay pursuant to this Policy,
provided that, if the outside work for pay includes patient care or
administrative or consulting activities significantly related to, but
not directly involved in, the provision of patient care, the income
derived therefrom is subject to the provisions of the Michigan State
University Practice Plan. Faculty in the College of Veterinary Medicine
may engage in outside work for pay pursuant to this Policy, provided
that private practice by faculty in the College of Veterinary Medicine
may occur only in accordance with College of Veterinary Medicine policy,
and provided further that, if a practice plan is established for the
College of Veterinary Medicine in the future, any income derived by a
faculty member of the College of Veterinary Medicine from private
practice will be subject to the provisions of that practice plan.

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Footnotes:

^1^This Policy does not apply to unrenumerated outside activities,
whether of a charitable or professional nature. However, faculty members
are expected to arrange their outside activities so as to avoid
conflicts of commitment. A \"conflict of commitment\" occurs when the
time and attention a faculty member devotes to outside activities
interferes with the performance of his/her responsibilities to the
University.

^2^Executive managers (senior level University administrators, including
associate and assistant vice presidents and specified directors) and
academic administrators (e.g., deans, department chairs, and school
directors) are also subject to this Policy and must obtain prior written
approval from their direct supervisor before engaging in outside work
for pay.

^3^A faculty member or unit administrator may (1) request an individual
or group exemption from specific provisions of this Policy, or (2)
request that a particular activity or type of activity be exempt from
this Policy. Such requests must be approved in writing by the applicable
department chair/director and dean/separately reporting director and by
the Provost or his/her designee. Failure to request or receive exemption
approval in writing results in coverage of the activity under this
Policy.

^4^Faculty using University facilities, supplies and materials,
services, or equipment for outside work for pay do not need to reimburse
the University for the fair market value of the use if it is a de
minimis, incidental use which imposes no, or little, additional cost or
expense on the University.\
