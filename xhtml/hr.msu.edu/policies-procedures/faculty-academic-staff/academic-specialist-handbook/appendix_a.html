The specific description of duties, including the partitioning of effort among functional areas will be contained in the specific position description for the individual at the time of appointment. Advancement based on an individual's responsibilities in more than one functional area would, of course, depend on an appropriately weighted assessment of that individual in each area of responsibility. Identification of a primary functional area for the individual will be done by the Associate Provost and Associate Vice President for Academic Human Resources as part of the position establishment procedures in accordance with established guidelines.</div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>A.1 TERMS OF APPOINTMENT<br/>
            </strong>Individuals who are appointed in the Academic Specialist Appointment System may hold the rank of academic specialist or senior academic specialist. Appointments may be made in any academic unit that reports directly or indirectly to the Provost or the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies. Individuals appointed in the Academic Specialist Appointment System will have ongoing student and faculty interactions, contribute directly to the academic affairs of the unit and must accomplish the goals and objectives of the department, school, college or other designated academic unit.</p>
         <p xmlns="">The academic credentials and the appropriate educationally related experiences and specific duties will vary depending on the nature of the appointment; however, it is expected that the academic specialist will normally have a primary assignment in either academic advising/teaching/curriculum development, research or service/outreach, but may also have other responsibilities including one or more of the referenced functional areas. Changes in characteristics and/or responsibilities of the position are more likely to result in a change in administrative title or functional area designation rather than a change in rank to that of senior academic specialist. Promotion to the rank of senior academic specialist, reappointment and the award of continuing appointment status will be determined using the guidelines of the Academic Specialist Appointment System.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>A.2 MERIT AS A BASIS FOR REAPPOINTMENT AND PROMOTION<br/>
            </strong>Reappointment of the academic specialist, including the award of continuing appointment status and promotion to the rank of senior academic specialist, must be based on meritorious performance, not merely time spent in the position. General characteristics and responsibilities are included in later sections specific to the particular functional areas. However, the underlying premise is that individuals appointed as academic specialists are professionals dedicated to the performance of their responsibilities, the advancement of the University and maintaining Michigan State University as a premier land-grant, AAU University. The listing of criteria is not intended to be exhaustive. Nor would a single individual necessarily be measured by all the criteria related to a given functional group, even if the duties of that individual fell only within one functional area. Rather, the individual would be evaluated according to the subset of criteria from each functional area involved that is appropriate to the particular position.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>A.3 GENERAL PROCESS FOR REAPPOINTMENT AND PROMOTION<br/>
            </strong>Reappointment, including the award of continuing appointment status and promotion to the rank of senior academic specialist, is predicated on the exemplary performance of assigned duties, professional development, excellence in scholarly activity, leadership and contributions to the institution.</p>
         <div xmlns="">
            <ul>
               <li>Consistent with the reappointment/promotion timetable, individuals who believe they have developed an appropriate record of activity and competence may assemble a compendium of scholarly achievements and submit such documentation to support consideration for reappointment or promotion. Such documentation may consist of evidence to substantiate excellence in relevant scholarly activities, i.e., course/curriculum development, teaching, publications, public service/outreach, academic advising, grants, creativity in program development and leadership in other areas related to assigned duties.</li>
               <li>It is to be recognized that no one individual is to be required to perform or excel in all three functional areas. The initial or subsequent appointment description defines the basic area(s) in which the individual should devote energy and attention in career progression.</li>
               <li>The unit review committee for academic specialist reappointment or promotion should be provided with guidelines and directed to determine objectively the level of accomplishment and excellence in the relevant academic specialist functional area(s) and specific duty assignments. Each academic specialist is to be evaluated based on individual merit.</li>
               <li>Recommendations of the review committee are forwarded to the appropriate academic unit administrator. The recommendation of the academic unit administrator is forwarded for subsequent review and action by the relevant major academic unit administrator (usually the dean) and by the Office of the Provost.</li>
               <li>Upon approval by the Provost, the academic specialist will be notified of the recommended action.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>A.4 PROMOTION TO THE RANK OF SENIOR ACADEMIC SPECIALIST </strong>
            <br/>In addition to excellence in performance which warrants reappointment and/or continuing appointment status, a small number of academic specialists may achieve a level of distinction to justify promotion to the rank of senior academic specialist. Such a distinction is to be limited to a small number of individuals appointed in the academic specialist appointment system. The basis for such a promotion recommendation is to be derived from a significantly long and sustained period of excellence in the performance of assigned duties together with the recognition by peers and colleagues both within the University and regionally, nationally and internationally. Such recognition is to be based on external peer review involving evaluation of performance in one or more of the assigned functional areas: teaching/advising/curriculum development, research, public service/outreach. Only in unusual cases would an individual not previously appointed at Michigan State University be appointed at the rank of senior academic specialist. This rank designation is limited to individuals who either have continuing appointment status or would achieve such a status on positive recommendation for promotion to the rank of senior academic specialist. Academic specialists with fixed term appointments who have completed 60 FTE service months are eligible for promotion to senior academic specialist, subject to the same standards and criteria applicable to individuals in the continuing appointment system. (Specialists with fixed term appointments are not eligible for the rank of senior academic specialist upon appointment). A promotion recommendation requires endorsement not only by the immediate academic unit administrator but by intermediate administrators (usually the Dean) and the Provost.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>A.5 CHARACTERISTICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br/>
            </strong>The principal activities of academic specialists are confined to three functional areas (academic advising/teaching/curriculum development, research and service/outreach). Guidance for the assignment of academic specialists to one of the three functional areas and on whether a particular position should be placed within the Academic Specialist Appointment System is described in a document entitled Guidelines for Specialist Placements, which appears as Appendix B. <strong>The characteristic duties and responsibilities included in Section A.5. are not intended to supersede the guidelines for specialist placements but only to provide examples of typical activities.</strong>
         </p>
         <p xmlns="">As noted, each academic specialist is classified as being in one functional area in which the individual expends a relevantly significant amount of effort in assigned duties. The academic specialist routinely will have duties which fall into more than one functional area plus other assignments. The specific description of assigned duties is contained in the job description for the individual position. Reappointment/continuing appointment status and promotion of an individual with responsibilities in multiple functional areas will depend on an appropriately weighted assessment of performance in each area. The following detailed descriptions provide a suggested array of duties that may be performed by academic specialists; they are not intended as listings of required job duties.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>A.5.1 ADVISING/TEACHING/CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT<br/>
            </strong>The academic specialist in this category is actively involved in the instruction/curricular activities of the University. This category is divided into three sub groups: individuals primarily involved in advising students on curricular matters, individuals primarily involved in delivering instruction and individuals primarily involved in curriculum development.</p>
         <p xmlns="">
            <strong>A.5.1.1 ADVISING</strong> <br/>The academic advising category includes individuals who provide advisement on course options and other academically related matters.

This may involve significant responsibilities in promoting and contributing to the efficient and effective management of the applicable unit or program with the related responsibility of attracting and managing resources, funding, material and/or people to achieve unit/program goals and to maintain administrative accountability. The individual with an appropriate assignment as an academic specialist in one or more of the three previously designated functional areas may be assigned such administrative duties with a relevant title in addition to designation as an academic specialist or senior academic specialist.
