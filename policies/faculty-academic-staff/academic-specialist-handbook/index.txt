Academic Specialist Handbook {#academic-specialist-handbook-1 xmlns=""}
============================

### 1.0 Disclaimer {#disclaimer xmlns=""}

The Academic Specialist Handbook contains employment policies
specifically related to employment as an Academic Specialist in the
Academic Specialist Continuing Appointment System and as an Academic
Specialist in a fixed term appointment. This document does not replace
or modify other existing University policies, which remain in effect for
all University employees. In circumstances where the Academic Specialist
Handbook is silent on an issue, the applicable policy contained in the
Faculty Handbook prevails.

For fixed term Academic Specialists covered by the Union of Non-Tenure
Track Faculty (UNTF) bargaining unit, the terms and conditions of
employment are governed by the collective bargaining agreement between
the University and the UNTF. In cases where only a portion of the
Academic Specialist\'s work duties and responsibilities are covered by
the UNTF collective bargaining agreement, the specific facts of the
individual case will determine the appropriate process to be used for
investigations, discipline, and grievances. In these cases, and in
situations where the UNTF agreement is silent on an issue, the Office of
Employee Relations or Academic Human Resources should be contacted to
determine the appropriate course of action.

### 1.1 Roles of Academic Specialists in the University {#roles-of-academic-specialists-in-the-university xmlns=""}

The principal responsibilities of the academic specialist fall into one
or more of three functional areas:

::: {xmlns=""}
1.  Academic advising/teaching/curriculum development
2.  Research
3.  Service/Outreach
:::

The academic specialist normally is identified with the one functional
area into which the majority of duties fall. Characteristically, the
academic specialist performs activities in one or more functional areas
in addition to the primary area. The academic specialist has a collegial
relationship within the academic community by fostering an exchange of
ideas, views, and perspectives. The academic specialist has a
responsibility to the University to strive for academic excellence and
to be held accountable for academic integrity. The evaluation criteria
for a particular position and the individual who fills that position
will reflect an appropriately weighted combination of the functional
areas that apply. An extensive description of the functional areas and
associated duties of the academic specialist is found in Appendix A.

### 1.2 General Definition {#general-definition xmlns=""}

The Academic Specialist Appointment System consists of individuals
appointed to one of two ranked levels: senior academic specialist or
academic specialist. Appointments are made in units reporting directly
or indirectly to the Provost or the Vice President for Research and
Graduate Studies. Academic specialists may be appointed on a fixed term
or continuing basis, full-time or part-time, with either an academic
year (nine-month) or an annual (twelve-month) duty assignment. The fixed
term academic specialist is appointed with an end date on an academic
year or annual basis or for shorter periods. Generally, repeated fixed
term appointments should not be used as a mechanism to by-pass the
continuing appointment system. However, positions funded with grant or
other non-general funds normally are fixed term in nature. The
continuing system academic specialist is initially appointed to a
probationary appointment. In unusual cases, a senior academic specialist
may be granted continuing appointment status from the date of
appointment see Section 4.8. Excellent performance during the
probationary appointments may lead to the award of continuing
appointment status for the individual. Continuing academic specialists
are appointed at 50% time or greater.

Continuing appointment status assures that the academic specialist will
not be dismissed due to capricious action by the University nor will
dismissal be used as a restraint of academic freedom or other civil
rights. As in the tenure system and librarian continuing appointment
system, continuing appointment status does not guarantee employment if
positions are not funded, if gross misconduct occurs, if the academic
specialist refuses to perform reasonable assigned duties, or fails to
fulfill contractual obligations, or if the academic specialist is no
longer able to perform satisfactorily in his or her professional
capacity at the University.

Assignments for all academic specialists involve applicable assigned
duties (academic advising/teaching/curriculum development, research, and
service/outreach responsibilities) and related professional development
activities. For academic specialists appointed on an annual (AN) year
basis, salaries are paid in twelve monthly installments on the last
working day of each month except for individuals appointed on an annual
basis for less than 12 months who receive salaries on a monthly basis
during the stipulated period. The academic specialist appointed on an
academic year (AY) basis is normally assigned duties during the period
August 16 to May 15; salaries are paid in ten installments on the last
working day of the month over the duty period, August 16 through May
15.  There is no vacation entitlement apart from official University
holidays for academic specialists with an academic year appointment. 
The academic specialist appointed on an annual basis is assigned duties
for a full calendar year or the specified period of appointment and is
eligible for stipulated vacation periods and official University
holidays.
